APCS1_Fall_Final

Java Gui Blackjack.


Directions:

To run this file do java -jar BlackjackSemesterOne.jar

----To start game Press Play. Enter an amount to bet based on the money you have(it will not catch if you bet something you don't have). The top Cards are the Dealer cards and the bottom cards are your's.
----If you Decide to Stay The dealer card will flip and will draw another card if he needs to. If the dealer value is still less than 17, press stay again until a message pops up on the screen dictating the result of the hand.
----If you decide to hit and the dealer is less than 17, He will draw a card and so will you.
----If you draw and bust, you will get a message saying you bust and the dealer won't show his card.
----If you hit and the dealer doesn't need to and beats you, he will not show his card.
----You can only hit once.

Non Functional:
There are some bugs in the program. Sometimes the score will get messed up, nothing happens if money goes negative and we were unable to make the ace worth both 1 and 11. The ace solely represents an 11.

We attempted to make the files compile without the jar but were unable to do so. The jar file contains those files which we used in netbeans to help compile/finish our project. We tried to compile those files in this directory but did not work. But these are the same files we used to run the Program.

Thank you
