APCS1_Fall_Final

Java GUI Blackjack.

Directions:

To run this file, enter java -jar BlackjackSemesterOne.jar into Terminal

----To start game press "PLAY". Enter an amount to bet based on the money you have (it will not catch exceeding amounts). The top cards represent the Dealer's hand; the bottom cards, yours.
----If you decide to "Stay", the dealer's rightmost card will flip and the dealer will draw another card if necessary (hand value < 17). If the dealer's hand value is still less than 17, press stay again until a message pops up on the screen dictating the result of the hand.
----If you decide to "Hit" and the dealer's hand value is less than 17, both players will draw a card.
----If you draw and bust (hand value > 21), you will get a message while the dealer's card remains hidden.
----If you hit and the dealer doesn't need to and ends with a greater value than yours, he will not show his card.
----You can only hit once.

Non Functional:
There are some bugs in the program. Sometimes the score will get messed up, nothing happens if money goes negative and we were unable to make the ace worth both 1 and 11. The ace solely represents an 11.

We attempted to make the files compile without the jar but were unable to do so. The jar file contains those files which we used in netbeans to help compile/finish our project. We tried to compile those files in this directory but did not work. But these are the same files we used to run the Program.

Thank you
