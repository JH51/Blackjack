APCS1_Fall_Final

Java GUI Blackjack.

Directions:
To run this file, enter java -jar BlackjackSemesterOne.jar into Terminal
----To start game press "PLAY". Enter an amount to bet based on the money you have (it will not catch exceeding amounts). The top cards represent the Dealer's hand; the bottom cards, yours.
----If you decide to "Stay", the dealer's rightmost card will flip and the dealer will draw another if necessary. If the dealer's hand value is still less than 17, press "Stay" again until a message appears on the screen dictating the result of the hand.
----If you decide to "Hit" and the dealer's hand value is less than 17, both players will draw a card.
----If you draw and bust (hand value > 21), a message will appear on-screen while the dealer's card remains hidden.
----If you hit and the dealer doesn't need to and ends with a greater value than yours, he will not show his card.
----You can only hit once per round.

Non Functional:
On occasion, Score will not update correctly.
Nothing happens if money goes below zero.
The Ace cards solely represent a face value of 11, only.
We attempted to make the files compile without the jar but were unable to do so. The jar file contains the files which we used in NetBeans to help compile/finish our project.

Thank you
